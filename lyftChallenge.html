	<h4>Propt</h4>
	<p>Calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude / longitude pairs, where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.</p>

	<h4>My Solution</h4>
	<p>I conclued that there were two possible solutions that must be considered: the route ACBD or the route CABD. I calculate these distances with the help of Google Maps API.</p>

	<h4>Directions</h4>
	<p>Drop pins on the map in the order A, B, C, then D. Press calculate to calculate which route is the better one to take.</p>
